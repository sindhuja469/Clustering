#  Results Analysis and Interpretation

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The initial exploration of the QS World University Rankings dataset revealed:
- The dataset included **1,501 universities** and **30 attributes**.
- Missing data occurred mainly in *International Faculty Ratio (IFR)*, *International Student Ratio (ISR)*, and *Sustainability Score (SUS)* columns.
- **Academic Reputation (AR SCORE)** and **Employer Reputation (ER SCORE)** were highly skewed toward top-performing universities.
- **Boxplots** revealed outliers in research and faculty metrics, indicating performance variation across institutions.

**Interpretation:**  
Top-ranked universities consistently achieve high reputation scores, while mid- and lower-ranked universities show variability, especially in research and internationalization performance.

## 2. K-Means Clustering

### Elbow & Silhouette Method
- The **Elbow Method** indicated 3â€“4 optimal clusters.  
- Silhouette scores for various `k` values:  
  - k = 2 â†’ 0.39  
  - k = 3 â†’ 0.31  
  - k = 4 â†’ 0.28  

### PCA Visualization
- At **k = 4**, clusters overlapped significantly.  
- At **k = 3**, clusters were better separated in the PCA plot.

**Interpretation:**  
Universities naturally grouped into **three meaningful clusters**:
1. **Elite Universities:** Top global performers with strong academic, employer, and research metrics.  
2. **Strong Performers:** Balanced performance across all metrics with potential to improve in citations and international exposure.  
3. **Emerging Institutions:** Developing universities with lower research or internationalization scores.

## 3. Hierarchical Clustering
Using **Agglomerative Clustering (Ward linkage)**:
- The dendrogram revealed **3â€“4 primary clusters**, consistent with K-Means results.
- Institutions with similar research and internationalization patterns tended to merge early in the hierarchy.

**Interpretation:**  
The hierarchical model validated the results of K-Means, confirming three stable clusters based on global performance metrics.

## 4. Random Forest Classification â€“ Ranking Tier Prediction

### Created Ranking Tiers:
- ðŸ¥‡ Top 100  
- ðŸ¥ˆ 101â€“300  
- ðŸ¥‰ 301â€“600  
- ðŸŽ“ 601+  

### Model Performance:
| Metric | Validation Set | Test Set |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Accuracy** | 90% | 91% |
| **Precision (601+ Tier)** | 0.94 | 0.93 |
| **Recall (601+ Tier)** | 0.98 | 0.98 |
| **Precision (Top 100)** | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| **Recall (Top 100)** | 0.75 | 0.90 |

**Interpretation:**  
- The model achieved **excellent accuracy** and balance between precision and recall.  
- It accurately identified **Top 100** and **601+** universities.  
- Overlap between **101â€“300** and **301â€“600** tiers suggests similar performance characteristics among mid-ranked universities.

## 5. Feature Importance Analysis

### Top 5 Influential Features:
1. **Academic Reputation (AR SCORE)**  
2. **Employer Reputation (ER SCORE)**  
3. **Citations per Faculty (CPF SCORE)**  
4. **Faculty/Student Ratio (FSR SCORE)**  
5. **International Faculty Ratio (IFR SCORE)**  

**Interpretation:**  
Reputation metrics dominate ranking outcomes, confirming their central role in global university prestige.  
However, research output and teaching quality (CPF and FSR) also significantly contribute to rank differentiation.

## 6. Optimized Random Forest Model (GridSearchCV)

### Best Parameters:
```python
{'max_depth': 10, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 200}

- The optimized model achieved 90% accuracy, improving generalization.

- Confusion matrices showed fewer misclassifications, particularly in the middle ranking tiers.

### Overall Conclusion
- Clustering Analysis: Revealed three natural university groups, illustrating global performance segmentation.
- Classification Model: Achieved high accuracy, effectively predicting ranking tiers.
- Key Drivers: Academic and employer reputation are the strongest determinants of rank.
- Research Insight: Combining unsupervised and supervised learning offers a comprehensive, data-driven understanding of global university performance.

### Summary Insights:
The combination of clustering and predictive modeling provides a strong analytical foundation for understanding global university competitiveness.
Institutions can use these findings to benchmark their standing and identify areas for strategic improvement in research, reputation, and internationalization.
